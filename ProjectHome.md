# Description #
This project has been created to store and share scripts to simplify forensic computer examination.  Previously, the focus was on nautilus-scripts, executable scripts from the Gnome Nautilus file browser accessible through the right-click menu.

# Purpose #
The purpose of the project is to host the tools I build for digital forensics and get developer input and user feedback.

### Nautilus-Scripts ###
The primary purpose of these scripts is to augment forensic boot CD projects like CAINE (http://www.caine-live.net) for field use by criminal investigators.  It is hoped that the scripts here will make forensic previewing of digital evidence simpler process and ease the workload of computer forensic laboratories by eliminating work through field triage.  The scripts provide a means to obtaining sufficient evidence to propel an investigation forward without the need of laboratory intervention, if desired.

### iPhone Tools ###
The primary purpose of these scripts is to facilitate the extraction of digital evidence from files found iPhone file systems.  Because there are numerous ways to obtain files from iPhones (backups, forensic hardware/software, direct USB access to the "sandbox" location), no attempt is made to automate the discovery of the target files themselves.  Instead, the tools present simplified methods for extracting data from the target files, including the address book, call history, SMS, and consolidated databases, as well as obtaining GPS and Apple Store user information from photos, videos, and music files.
